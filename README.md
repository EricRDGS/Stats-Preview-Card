## My process

First I created the structure, added the main tag, then the section tag, the divs and etc, and then I created the css and styled it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I had a little difficulty in certain decisions of tags and css properties, I think that after solving this challenge I was able to better learn some properties of flex.

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge in flexbox and grid, know how to use them better.
